    A cell is analogous to a discrete/atomic spacial-unit and quanta is the matter that fills up that unit of space.
    It is at this smallest unit of space that we care about causality. There are two ways that this protocol may be
    implemented: (1) we store the attributes on the Cell object, or (2) we only store an address to those values in
    the topology. The second way is preferable, but one must be careful to only make references to that which they
    know won't change unexpectedly. The second way has the added benefit of additional information attached to each
    cell, namely its location. This is significant because each Cell is therefore treated as a constant location
    in space, regardless of what quanta happens to occupy it. An implementation of method (2) can be found in the
    CellVector implementation (topologies.vector).

    Note that the `destroyed_at` attribute was deprecated due to adding memory that is rarely used, and is harder to
    track (due to multi-ways) under a data-oriented approach (problems with lists of lists in numpy for instance).
    Flow.find_cell_lifespan is used instead and provides much better support for multiways.
